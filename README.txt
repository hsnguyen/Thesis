The University of Queensland thesis LaTeX class file.
====================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a LaTeX class file (and associated style files provided with
the package but falling under different copyright agreements) that
can be used in the preparation of Honours and PhD theses at the
University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The files are distributed as a simple .tar.gz or .zip file.  Uncompress this
file with your decompression utitlity, and you will be presented with a
"uqthesis" directory.  Within this directory you will find the uqthesis.cls
file.  This is the main class file that you call from your LaTeX document to
use the University of Queensland styles.  In this directory are several .sty
files.  These are provided for convenience, and to make sure that the files
included have the same functionality as those used in developing the style
file.  There is also a defs_thesis.tex file which is useful for defining macros
useful in reducing the amount of typing you do in your thesis for certain
repetitive commands.  The uqthesis.bst file is the style file used for
generating the bibliography.  This was automatically generated using the
makebst program and conforms to the UQ guidelines for bibliographies.  You will
also find an example_thesis directory.  Within this directory is an example
thesis file and generic structure for the document as a whole.  Have a go at
typesetting the thesis.tex file therein.

To start your thesis off, copy the example_thesis directory to another
location, calling it something different (phdthesis for example).  Then copy
the uqthesis.cls file, the .sty files, the defs_thesis.tex file and the
uqthesis.bst file into this new directory.  You will then be well on your way
to having a good looking thesis, typeset in LaTeX.  Good luck!
